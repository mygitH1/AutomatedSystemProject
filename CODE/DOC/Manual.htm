<P>Web-Enabled Automated Manufacturing Process:</P>

</B><P>The system creates a web based Manufacturing System that enables a Manufacturing industry to schedule its manufacturing operations based on the daily update of sales from its dealers. Once the sales figures of items for the past week are entered by the Dealers over the internet along with the Orders for the next delivery, the schedule for the next week’s production will be drawn up. A report of the required raw materials or parts will be drawn up with the approved suppliers for each suppliers will be intimated about the product requirements over the internet &amp; asked to quote their rates. Once the rates are quoted, the Order will be placed with the required delivery schedules.  </P>

<P>Once the parts are supplied the Stocks will be updated. Then a production plan will be drawn up taking the bill-of-materials into consideration. Once the Production plan is approved, the Stock will be updated when the material is issued. Once the finished products are available the Delivery schedules will be drawn up based on the Orders placed by the Dealers. The stocks with the dealers will also be maintained. </P>
